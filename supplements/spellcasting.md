## Concentration

### Rules
- Only one concentration spell at a time
- Casting another concentration spell ends the first
- Taking damage: Constitution save (DC = 10 or half damage, whichever higher)
- Being incapacitated or killed ends concentration
- Environmental interference (DM discretion)

### Tracking
Mark concentration spells clearly when cast:
```
[CONCENTRATING: Bless, 8 rounds remaining]
```

Prompt for concentration saves when the caster takes damage.

## Spell Components

### Material Component Rules
- Components without gold cost: Replaced by focus or component pouch
- Components with gold cost: Must have the specific item
- Components consumed: Must be replaced after casting
- Components not consumed: Can be reused indefinitely

Example: *Revivify* requires diamonds worth 300 gp which ARE consumed.

## Ritual Casting

### Rules

| **10 minutes** | Ritual time or preparation |
| **1 hour+** | Extended casting, usually out of combat |

### Bonus Action Spell Rule

## Counterspell and Dispel Magic

### Counterspell
- Reaction when you see a creature within 60 ft casting

## Describing Magic

Make spellcasting feel significant:

**Mechanical**: "I cast Fireball."

**Better**: "Vira traces a quick sigil in the air, words of power tumbling from her lips as a tiny bead of orange light streaks from her fingertip toward the cluster of goblins..."

Consider:
- **Verbal**: What language? What tone? Ancient words, sung phrases, shouted commands?
- **Somatic**: Elegant gestures? Violent motions? Subtle finger movements?
- **Visual**: What does the magic look like? Color, texture, sound?
- **Feel**: Does it smell like ozone? Feel cold? Raise hair on arms?

## Spell Slot Recovery

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Long Rest** | All spell slots recovered |
| **Arcane Recovery** (Wizard) | Short rest, recover slots = half wizard level (rounded up), once per day |
| **Font of Magic** (Sorcerer) | Convert sorcery points to slots and vice versa |
| **Pact Magic** (Warlock) | All pact slots recover on short rest |

## Common Spell Rulings

### Line of Sight vs Line of Effect
- Most spells require clear path to target
- Glass blocks line of effect but not sight
- Total cover blocks both

### Areas of Effect
- **Cone**: Starts at origin point, widens
- **Cube**: Origin on one face
- **Cylinder**: Origin at center of circular base
- **Line**: Straight from origin in direction of choice
- **Sphere**: Origin at center

### Stacking
- Same spell from different sources doesn't stack (most potent applies)
- Different spells stack
- Same spell at different levels: use higher level effect
